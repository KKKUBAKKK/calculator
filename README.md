# calculator
This calculator was my first project during the first month of studies. It can do basic mathematical operations in system from binary to hexadecimal. It can also convert numbers between them. It works for numbers of any size.

This calculator is working but wasn't improved for a long time, so it's certainly not optimal and you may encounter a bug. It also works with only very specific input. The example files are uploaded and named '0{number}_in.txt'.
